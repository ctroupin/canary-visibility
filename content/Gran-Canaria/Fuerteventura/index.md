Seeing Fuerteventura from Gran Canaria is often related to weather predictions., everyboday had already heard the saying:

> If Fuerteventura can be seen, rain will come for sure.

However one can see in many occasions that having Fuerteventura at the horizon does not imply that it will rain.  
In fact it is even possible to see Fuerteventura during desert dust (_calima_) events.

Due to its low summit (807 m), the island is often hidden by the typical stratocumulus layer driven by the Trade Winds.
