- Shortest distance: 95 km

Seeing Fuerteventura from Gran Canaria is often related to short-tem, weather predictions. Everybody has already heard the saying:

> If Fuerteventura can be seen, rain will come for sure.

However one can see in many occasions that having Fuerteventura at the horizon does not imply that it will rain. In fact it is even possible to see Fuerteventura during desert dust (_calima_) events, depending on the altitude of the dust layer.

Due to the low altitude of its summit (807 m), the island is often hidden by the typical stratocumulus layer driven by the Trade Winds. 


## Photographers
