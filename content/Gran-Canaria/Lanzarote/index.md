## Lanzarote or Fuerteventura?

This is also a special case: you can frequently read and hear that Lanzarote is (easily) observable from Gran Canaria.
Yet most of the time, it not Lanzatote, but rather the northern or the cental parts of Fuerteventura.
This island takes a wide portion of the horizon due to its length (more than 100 km).


## What can be seen?

Lanzarote can be seen with the naked eye but you need to know where to look for it.     
With a teleobjective you can get a picture showing 3 main summits located in the southern part of the island:
1. Atalaya de Femés (608 m),
2. Pico Redondo (551 m) and
3. Hacha Grande (561 m).
If the altitude allows it, then you can even see other peaks furthern north, up to the Caldera Blanca (460 m).

## What about la Graciosa?


Due to its position (north of Lanzarote) and its altitude (267 m), La Graciosa cannot be obsetrved neither from GGran Canaria, nor from tenerife.


## Good locations

Most of the pictures shown here were taken from Valleseco, at an altitude of approximately 1100 m.
Other easily accessible view points include:
- Cruce de Ariñez (intersection of roads GC-230 and GC-400);
- Along the road from Cruz de Tejeda to Cruce de los Llanos (GC-150); 
- Montañón Negro.
