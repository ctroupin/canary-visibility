## How far can we see?

## Why can't we see so well?

They are several reasons why one cannot see objects (islands) located at shorter distances.

## What about Africa? And the Salvage Islands?

The shortest distance between Fuerteventura and Morocco is around 100 km (la Entallada lighthouse), but the absence of high peaks in this area prevents one from observing Africa from the Canary Islands.

The case of the Salvage Islands (Portugal) is different, as it is theoretically possible to see the Teide from the Pico da Atalaia (163 m), though it is not easy to find a photo that demonstrates it.

## Useful tools and websites

### Simulators

* https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/makepanoramas.htm: generate panoramas given a position and a range of directions. One of the most used tool for distant sighting. 
* https://www.peakfinder.org: simulates panoramas over 360Â° from a given location.

### Other websites

* https://beyondrange.wordpress.com/: compilation of long distance photos, including the current Guiness World Record (443 km).
* https://horitzonsllunyans.wordpress.com/: distant photography, mostly in Spain (in Catalan).
* https://www.ing.iac.es//~crb/trav/lp/islandvis.html: they focus on the visibility from La Palma with maps, pictures and calculations.a
