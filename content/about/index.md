## How far can we see?

The visibility depends on several parameters, the most relevant is the altitude of the observer: the highest altitude, the farthest distance one can observe. With a bit of geometry and assuming Earth is a sphere of radius `R` equal to 6371 km, we can derive the formula to estimate the distance `D` to the horizon, knowing the altitude `H` of the observer:

$$ D ≃ \sqrt{2 h R}$$

for example:
- at 3 meters above sea level: the horizon is located at 6 km;
- from Pico de las Nieves (1949 m): 158 km
- from Pico del Teide (3715 m): 218 km.

This does not mean that one cannot observe anything behind that distance: an object at altitude `h` can be seen, provided that the relation

$$ D \lt 3.57 \times (\sqrt{h} + \sqrt{H}) $$

is satisfied. For example, the distance `D` between el Teide and Pico de las Nieves is about 110 km.

$$ 110 \lt 3.57 \times (\sqrt{1949} + \sqrt{3715}) = 220 $$

The condition is satisfied (110 < 220).

## Why can't we see so well?

They are several reasons why one cannot see objects (islands) located at shorter distances.

## What about Africa? And the Salvage Islands?

The shortest distance between Fuerteventura and Morocco is around 100 km (la Entallada lighthouse), but the absence of high peaks in this area prevents one from observing Africa from the Canary Islands.

The case of the Salvage Islands (Portugal) is different, as it is theoretically possible to see the Teide from the Pico da Atalaia (163 m), though it is not easy to find a photo that demonstrates it.

## Useful tools and websites

### Simulators

* https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/makepanoramas.htm: generate panoramas given a position and a range of directions. One of the most used tool for distant sighting. 
* https://www.peakfinder.org: simulates panoramas over 360° from a given location.

### Other websites

* https://beyondrange.wordpress.com/: compilation of long distance photos, including the current Guiness World Record (443 km).
* https://horitzonsllunyans.wordpress.com/: distant photography, mostly in Spain (in Catalan).
* https://www.ing.iac.es//~crb/trav/lp/islandvis.html: they focus on the visibility from La Palma with maps, pictures and calculations.
